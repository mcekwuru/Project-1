	<h1>About Us</h1>
	<p> Mimi's Boutique is a start-up ready-to-wear retail establishment that will sell trendy African inspired fashion at an affordable prices.
 With her love for fashion and passion for self expression through unique clothing, Nigerian born Miriam Ekwuru launched the Mimi's Boutique at the beginning of 2018.
Mimi's Boutique is created to inspire individuals to confidently dress bold and beautifully while embracing the african culture through fashion. 
While our initial goal is to open one boutique, expansion plans include potentially franchising our retail store and/or building a well-recognized brand name. 
All garments are currently made in Maryland with great attention to quality. In turn, we would hope to penetrate a sizable portion of the online retail market.
<br><br>The fashion and retail industry tends to be overly youth focused. 
However, by closely following generational fashion trends as well as our own customers’ purchasing preferences, we will tailor our inventory to meet the specific needs of our clientele. 
We will solely focus on the our styles, colors and fits to the africans will be our specialty.

<br><br>Mimi's Boutique will sell a combination of widely recognized name brands as well as clothing lines from select fashion designers. 
We will closely follow generational fashion trends as well as our own customers’ purchasing preferences. Moreover, we will tailor our inventory to meet the needs of our “african” clientele. 
Solely focusing on the styles, colors and fits to flatter africans will be our specialty. 
While apparel, such as head-wraps, dresses of all kind, pants, and also home decors will be our main staple, we will also offer some accessories such as neckless, earrings, and bracelet.
